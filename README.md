# DNA
Daily Nutrients Analyzer - find nutrient values of food by taking a picture of your meal.

# Disclaimer
Project as-is, not intended nor ready for actual daily use. Project intended to showcase my skills of web development.

- Highlights: 
  * Succession of 3 API calls without affecting user experience.
  * UI design manually created (except the fonts).
  * First Mobile Application.

- TODO
  * Refactoring O(n2) of creating `Food` for each `food` in picture.
  * Changes in options for each food should reflect changes in macronutrients.

## Getting started
To run the project you will need the following:
- `react-native` cli command
- xcode (for ios)
- Android Studio (for Android)

Assuming you have what is needed:
- download and `cd` into this repo
- run `npm install`
- run `react-native run-ios` or `react-native run-android` depending on your preference

Feel free to reach out with any questions.

Thank you for stopping by!
